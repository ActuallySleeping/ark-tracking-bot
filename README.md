# Discord bot for player and server tracking on ARK  
## Introduction  
This is my first projet regarding JavaScript as well as the use of GitHub  
My goal was to let people track who is online on a server of their choice
and be able to get warning when someone connected to a defined server  

## Commands  
**&s / &start** *x.x.x.x:p ...*  
Let you start the tracking of a server  
**&stop** *< messageid >*  
Stop the every tracking in a channel or only the one with the messageid you gave  
**&dc / &defaultcluster**  
Give a list of ip with the format x.x.x.x:p for some cluster 

**&c / &clear** *< amount >*  
Clear an amount of message, the default amount is 100
